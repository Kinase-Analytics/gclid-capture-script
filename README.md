# gclid-capture-script

- This repo contains a markdown file with the script recommended by google, which should be added to each web page on your site. You can either add the script to each page manually, or to a global part of the code such as the footer. 

- There is also another markdown file with the line of code that needs to be added to each lead form, which will capture the gclid on the submit of that form.
